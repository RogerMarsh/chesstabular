"""Provide open mailbox and configuration file methods for Tabular Results.

The chesstabular.core.configuration module is used rather than the one in
chessvalidate.core which is provided by the superclasses of SelectEmail
and Configure.

Module introduced in response to pylint duplicate-code message, and the
class is added to the ignored-classes list in pylint.conf to stop the
no-member error messages which replace the duplicate-code refactor message.
