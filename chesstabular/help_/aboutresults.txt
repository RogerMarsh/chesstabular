ChessResultsTabular converts source documents containing results of chess games to tabular format.


Run 'python -m pip show chesstabular' at a command line to display version and dependency (requires and required-by) information.

Version numbers for the packages listed under 'requires' are given in the setup.py file.

Run 'python -m pip check' at a command line to display discrepancies between required and installed versions of packages.

'python' may need to be replaced by <path to>python<version> depending on the system configuration: 'python3.8' for example.

ChessResultsTabular uses features introduced at Python3.4.

Python3.4, or later versions when available, must be installed to run ChessResultsTabular.

tkinter, part of Python, must be installed to run ChessResultsTabular.  Sometimes this is installed separately.
