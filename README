=================================================

.. contents::


Description
===========

The ChessValidate package is used to validate documents reporting results of chess games.

ChessTabular adds the ability to generate a tabular presentation of the validated results, in a CSV file, which is accepted as a source document by ChessValidate, ChessTabular, ChessSubmit, and the three variants of ChessResults.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is not available on PyPI, or any other package index, but can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user --trusted-host solentware.co.uk --find-links http://solentware.co.uk/wheels.html chesstabular

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.

Then run 'python -m pip check' to identify other packages which need to be installed.


Run
===

The command to run this package is:

   python -m chesstabular.tabular

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m chesstabular.tabular

   For example

      C:\\Python34\\python -m chesstabular.tabular

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 -m chesstabular.tabular

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting results_report.


Notes
=====

See the ChessValidate package README for requirements to accept various document formats such as *.docx or *.odt as source documents.

A CSV file can be a source document without being tabular.  A tabular CSV file has a specific number of columns with a specific set of column names.  Each row describes the whole context of the game: including event and section name, examples of things often left as assumptions to be made by the recipient in non-tabular CSV files.
